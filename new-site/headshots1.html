            <section>
              <p>Ironically, the “natural look” looks anything but natural. Actual natural makeup is quickly “washed out” under studio lights. And more makeup is not necessarily the answer. What looks good stepping out of a salon will not likely translate well to digital.</p>
              <p>This is for a variety of reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>skin pigmentation and tone respond differently to studio lighting</li>
                  <li>tendency to perspire can cause makeup streaking and blotching</li>
                  <li>facial angles and “best sides” make require more makeup attention to achieve a natural look</li>
                </ul>
              <p>And hair quality is no different.</p>
              <figure id="figure-02"></figure>

              <p>For example, often a client wants to try different clothing styles before settling on a final look. Hair responds to static in the clothing material and quickly becomes frizzy. Without quick attention, the frizzies too are showing up in the final results.
              For these reasons, professional sets always maintain a dedicated makeup and hairstyling staff so that the work always appears fresh and clean.

            <p>Our fees include any minimal photoshopping the final look may require. however, due to our process in-studio, any photoshopping will be minimal at most.</p>
            <p>Which is good for two reasons: </p>
            <p>Excellent photoshopping, the kind that isn't obvious, is painstakingly time consuming. Which means you wait longer for your photos.</p>
            <p>Too much digital editing, while erasing any blemishes missed during the photoshoot, will also erode natural, fresh vibrancy. Photographers that rush the studio process tend to over-rely on erasing mistakes with photoshop which can lead to an artificial and boring look.</p>
            <p>We choose our studio process because it eliminates much of the need for post-production editing, ensuring your photos look fresher and are received quicker.</p>

              <p>Other studios offer great prices – only to upsell “optional” services… like makeup and hairstyling.
              As I said, makeup and hairstyling are not optional for creating a professional look.

              <p>Our fee is final and includes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>one full hour of studio time</li>
