README:

introducing new method for updating github. will base updates on the following, loose criteria:
- size of upload
- time since previous upload
- demarcation, according to things like project milestones or tutorial sections

the idea is to give some meaning to the amount of uploads that occur during a day, rathen than just random decisions.

so, now the idea is this
- upload after completing exercises or section practice, if the size of files is not too large (and at this stage they will not)
- upload before completion of session, if the session is particularly lengthy (eg 12+ subsections)
This last point seems to correspond with time being an issue. The basic point is to do updates according to amount of work that needs to be updated.
