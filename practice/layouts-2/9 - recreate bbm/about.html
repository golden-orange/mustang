        <p>As an artistic coordinator, my success depends heavily upon solving problems for clients and utilizing strong organization, communication and ‘soft’ people skills.</p>

        <p>odels want to look compelling while mitigating the cost to their skin. Providing models with the best skin care is as important to me as the finished product.</p>
        <p>Every project is different. Variables include temperature and humidity, skin type, facial structure and so on.</p>
        <p>In my experience, the label alone does not ensure a dependable, quality result. The brands and products I use are chosen for their ability to perform under specific conditions.</p>
        <p>I import all my Japanese makeup products from Japan. These quality brands are highly specialized and are the same ones used by professionals in the theatrical, television and movie industries in Japan.</p>
